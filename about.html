We provide a plateform where which help students to save their time and they will not have to find one or other places to find study materials. We create library managment system website. Where students should register on the site and then they can freely download study related material.</p>

We design a system where we divided it into three categories PDF BOOKS, PDF PREVIOUS YEAR QUESTION PAPERS and PDF NOTES. We also divided into some categories like year/semester, branch and subject. Student can easily access or download pdf books, notes and papers. This will monitor by admin and they can make changes on it.</p>
